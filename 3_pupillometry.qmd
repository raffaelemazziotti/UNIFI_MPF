## What is the pupil?

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Why study the pupil:

- visible & measurable
- dynamically controlled
- tightly linked to brain state

Pupillometry provides a fast, non-invasive window into `autonomic` and `cognitive` processes. What the pupil is:

- the `variable opening` in the center of the iris
- regulating the amount of light entering the eye

It functions like the `aperture` of a camera.

:::column

:::info-box
Two muscles control pupil size:

- `Sphincter` pupillae → constriction
- `Dilator` pupillae → dilation

These muscles are controlled by different branches of the `autonomic nervous system`.


:::

## Pupillary Control

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
[Parasympathetic]{.highlight} ([ACh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine)) pathway:

- Retina
- Pretectal nucleus
- Edinger–Westphal nucleus
- Oculomotor nerve (III)
- Ciliary ganglion
- Sphincter muscle

This mediates the `pupillary light reflex` (PLR).
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
[Sympathetic]{.highlight} ([NE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine)) pathway:

- Hypothalamus
- Spinal cord (ciliospinal center)
- Superior cervical ganglion
- Dilator muscle

This mediates `pupil dilation` in darkness, stress, and arousal.

## Central neuromodulation

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Beyond reflexes, [pupil](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Functional-Organization-of-the-Sympathetic-Pathways-Szabadi/37dcaa8ff2edba07fb9c59bf9543fc39bbe0e473) size is influenced by:

- noradrenergic signaling
- cortical control systems
- attention networks

:::

:::info-box
The `locus coeruleus`:

- regulates arousal
- responds to novelty and uncertainty
- influences sympathetic activity

Pupil dilation is `correlated` with LC activity.

## Types of Pupillary phenomena

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Pupil diameter changes reflect multiple processes:

- light reflex & dark adaptation
- cognitive load
- emotional arousal
- decision, surprise and novelty

:::

:::info-box
`Pupillary light reflex`:

- rapid constriction
- latency around 200 ms
- highly reliable
- bilateral (direct and consensual)

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
`Dark adaptation`:

- pupil dilates
- sympathetic tone increases
- under stress or arousal: dilation occurs even at constant luminance
:::

:::info-box
`Cognitive load`

When task difficulty increases:

- pupil dilates
- even without luminance change

This is known as the `task-evoked pupillary response`.
:::

:::
:::

## Types of Pupillary phenomena

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
`Working Memory`

- more items in working memory
- larger pupil dilation
- dilation scales with effort

Pupil size tracks mental workload.
:::

:::info-box

During difficult `decisions`:

- pupil dilation increases
- uncertainty correlates with amplitude
- surprise produces phasic dilation

This links pupil to decision-making models.

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
`Emotionally salient stimuli`:

- increase pupil diameter
- regardless of valence
- scale with arousal intensity

Pupil reflects arousal, not emotional category.

## How pupillometry works

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Modern pupillometry uses:

- infrared illumination (850nm)
- video-based eye tracking
- automated pupil detection
- sampling rate (>5Hz)

Typical steps:

- record pupil diameter over time
- detect and remove blinks
- interpolate missing data
- baseline correction
- event-related averaging

## How pupillometry works

:::columns
:::column
:::info-box
Pupil is extremely sensitive to light. Therefore:

- stimulus luminance must be controlled
- screen brightness must be constant
- visual properties must be standardized

:::

:::info-box
Pupil responses:

- begin ~200–500 ms after event
- peak around 1–2 seconds
- decay slowly

Faster than hemodynamic signals  
but slower than EEG.

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box

Tonic vs phasic pupil signals

`Tonic` level:

- slow fluctuations
- linked to sustained arousal

`Phasic` response:

- rapid stimulus-locked dilation
- linked to cognitive events

Both are informative.
