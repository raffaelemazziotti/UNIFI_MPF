## Neurovascular Coupling

:::columns
:::column

Optical imaging methods do `not` measure neuronal activity `directly`.
They measure `vascular and metabolic changes` that follow neural activity.

:::info-box
Neural signaling `requires` energy for:

- `action potentials`
- `synaptic transmission`
- `ion pumping`
- `neurotransmitter recycling`

All of these processes increase `metabolic demand`.
:::

:::
:::column

:::
:::

## Neurovascular Unit

:::columns
:::column

:::card
Neurons rely almost entirely on: `glucose` and `oxygen`. These are delivered by the `vascular system`. Neural activity therefore requires a local `vascular response`.
:::

:::info-box
[Neurovascular coupling](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/12/5/442) refers to the set of mechanisms by which changes in neural activity lead to changes in:

- `cerebral blood flow` (CBF)
- `blood volume`
- `blood oxygenation`
:::

>This coupling is `local`, `regulated`, and `stimulus-dependent`.

:::
:::column

:::info-box

Neurovascular coupling is not controlled by neurons alone. It involves `interactions` between:

- `neurons`
- `astrocytes`
- `endothelial` cells
- `smooth muscle` cells

This is often referred to as the [neuro-glio-vascular unit](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.732820/full).

## Neurovascular Mechanisms


:::columns
:::column

There is not a single pathway linking neurons to vessels. Current models describe `3` main mechanisms:

- `direct` neuronal signaling
- `astrocyte-mediated` signaling
- `metabolic feedback` signaling

>These mechanisms act `in parallel`, not in isolation.

:::
:::column

![](docs/images/ios_vascular_brains.png){width="350" fig-align="center"}
![](docs/images/ios_penetrating_arterioles.jpg){width="350" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Mechanism 1: Direct neuronal signaling

:::columns
:::column

>Neurons can influence blood vessels `directly`.

:::info-box
This occurs through:

- neurotransmitter release
- neuromodulators
- gaseous messengers (like nitric oxide, aka NO)
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
In this mechanism:

- neural activity increases
- neurons release vasoactive substances
- nearby vessels dilate rapidly

This is often called a `feedforward` mechanism. It `anticipates` metabolic demand rather than reacting to it.

:::

:::
:::

## Properties of Direct Neuronal Signaling

:::columns
:::column

:::card
**Strengths**

- `fast`
- spatially `precise`
- tightly `linked to synaptic activity`
:::
:::

:::column

:::card
Limitations

- `not sufficient` alone
- does not encode metabolic state
- varies across neuron types
:::
:::
:::

>This mechanism is responsible for the `early vascular response`.

## Mechanism 2: Astrocyte-mediated signaling

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Astrocytes:

- sense synaptic activity
- integrate signals over space and time
- release vasoactive substances

They do not fire action potentials, but they actively regulate blood flow.
:::

![](docs/images/ios_synapse_tripartite.jpg){width="350" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Typical sequence after synaptic activation:

- glutamate activates astrocytic receptors
- intracellular calcium rises
- vasoactive signals are released (vasodilation)

This pathway is `slower` than direct neuronal signaling. Roles:

- integrate and smooth fast neural fluctuations
- contribute to spatial spread of vascular responses

This helps explain why vascular signals are `broader` than neural ones.

:::

:::
:::

## Mechanism 3: Metabolic feedback signaling

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Neural activity alters local metabolism.

This leads to changes in:

- `oxygen` levels
- `glucose` consumption
- carbon dioxide
- pH

These metabolic changes influence vessel tone.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
In this mechanism:

- neural activity consumes oxygen
- metabolic byproducts accumulate
- vessels respond to restore balance

This is a `feedback mechanism`, not feedforward. It `reflects actual energy use`.
:::

:::
:::

## The three mechanisms work together

:::columns
:::column
![](docs/images/ios_neurovascular_coupling.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Neurovascular coupling emerges from:

- `fast` neuronal feedforward signaling
- `intermediate` astrocytic integration
- `slower` metabolic feedback
:::

B --> E[Vascular response]

```

:::
:::

## Consequence for interpretation

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Important implications:

- signal amplitude ≠ firing rate
- timing reflects vascular dynamics
- spatial maps reflect integration
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Despite its complexity:

- coupling is reproducible
- spatially organized
- stimulus-dependent

This is why optical imaging works so well for mapping.
:::

:::
:::

## What does “intrinsic” mean?

:::columns
:::column

> Intrinsic signal optical imaging uses the brain’s own optical properties.

:::info-box
- No dyes.  
- No fluorescent reporters.  
- No genetic indicators.

The signal emerges from:

- `hemoglobin absorption`
- `blood volume` changes
- `light scattering` changes

:::


:::
:::column

![](images/ios_intrinsic_estrinsic.jpg){width="350" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Why the visual cortex?

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
The visual cortex is the `ideal model` system because:

- it has precise `topographic organization`
- responses are `stimulus-locked`
:::

:::info-box
`Retinotopy` is a functional property of several visual areas:

- neighboring points in visual space
- are represented by neighboring points in cortex

Different visual areas have a complete (almost) representation of the visual field.

:::


:::
:::column

```{mermaid}

C[Stimulus moves upward] --> D[Activation shifts dorsally]

```

![](images/ios_retinotopy2.png){width="250" fig-align="center"}
![](images/ios_retinotopy.jpeg){width="250" fig-align="center"}

In ISI:

- reflected light is recorded
- The readout is a `reflectance change over time`.

:::
:::

## Why reflectance changes{#reflectance_change}

:::columns
:::column

>Hemoglobin absorbs light.

:::info-box
Oxygenated (OHb) and deoxygenated (RHb) hemoglobin:

- have different `absorption spectra`
- absorb differently at different wavelengths

Therefore: changes in oxygenation → changes in reflectance.
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/ios_hemoglobin_spectrum(1).png){width="550" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Wavelength matters

:::columns
:::column

>Different wavelengths emphasize different components.

:::info-box
Around 610-680 nm:

- `RHb absorbs` strongly
- `active regions appear darker`
- `signal correlates with increased HbR`

Other wavelengths emphasize different dynamics.
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/ios_hemoglobin_spectrum(1).png){width="550" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Optical logic of ISI

:::columns
:::column

:::card
**Neural activation**

- increases oxygen consumption
- transient increase in HbR
- later increase in OHb
:::

:::card
**Optical consequence**

- reflectance decreases at HbR-sensitive wavelengths
- `spatially localized darkening`
- reproducible stimulus-locked maps
:::

:::
:::column

![](images/ios_setup.gif){width="350" fig-align="center"}
![](images/ios_signal_average.png){width="350" fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Early and late components

:::columns
:::column


:::info-box
The intrinsic signal has [components](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/27/17/4572):

- `initial dip` (early oxygen extraction)
- `hyperemic response` (increased blood flow)
- post-stimulus `undershoot`

These reflect the three mechanisms of neurovascular coupling.

## Mapping retinotopy with ISI

:::columns
:::column

:::card
Typical paradigm:

- moving bar stimulus
- drifting grating
- phase-encoded visual stimulation
:::

:::card
The cortical response:

- shifts smoothly
- mirrors stimulus movement
- produces continuous retinotopic maps
:::

## Mapping retinotopy with ISI

:::columns
:::column

:::card
The retinotopic organization is so strong that you can even draw on the visual cortex.

In this experiment we tried to understand what is the `stimulus shape` from the `activation pattern`.
As shown [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10336717): clear distinct activation patterns emerge after visual stimulation.

:::

## Beyond retinotopy

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
ISI has been used to map:

- `orientation` columns (not in the mouse)
- `ocular dominance` columns
- `somatosensory maps`
- `auditory maps`

It captures `mesoscale` cortical architecture.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
ISI provides:

- `high spatial resolution` (tens of micrometers)
- `large field of view`
- stable `functional maps`

This makes it ideal for `cortical mapping` in animals.
:::

:::
:::

## Strengths and Weaknesses

:::columns
:::column

:::card
`Strengths`

- no dyes required
- stable across sessions
- excellent for mapping cortex
- strong signal-to-noise ratio
- ideal for primary sensory cortices studies
:::

:::
:::column

:::card
`Weaknesses`

- signal is slow (seconds)
- reflects vascular integration (indirect signal)
- cannot resolve spikes or fast oscillations
- limited to surface cortex
- requires surgical preparation
- influenced by anesthesia 

:::

:::
:::

## What is fNIRS?

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a `non-invasive` method that measures changes in:

- OHb
- RHb

through `near-infrared` (NIr) light transmitted across the scalp.
:::


![](images/ios_optical_window.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Biological tissue has an `optical window` approximately between:

- `700 nm and 900 nm`

In this range:

- light penetrates scalp and skull
- hemoglobin absorbs selectively
- water and lipids absorb less

This makes deep measurement possible.
:::

:::
:::

## From reflectance to absorption

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
In `ISI`:

- light hits cortex
- `reflectance` changes are measured

In `fNIRS`:

- light enters scalp
- travels through tissue
- is partially absorbed
- exits at a detector

> We measure changes in light attenuation (`Absorbance`).

:::

:::
:::column


![](images/ios_light_paths.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## The Beer-Lambert principle

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
The core idea:

- the amount of light absorbed depends on
- the concentration of `absorbing molecules`
- and the `path length`
:::

:::card
In fNIRS, the absorbing molecules are:

- OHb
- RHb
:::

>We estimate concentration changes from light attenuation.

:::
:::column

:::info-box

OHb and RHb absorb light differently (see [absorption coefficients](#reflectance_change)). Using at least `2` wavelengths:

- allows `separation` of OHb and RHb signals
- enables `estimation` of relative concentration changes

This is called the `modified Beer–Lambert law`.

:::

:::info-box
fNIRS measures changes in:

- `OHb` and `RHb`
- Total hemoglobin (`THb` = OHb + RHb)
:::

:::
:::

## Typical activation pattern

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
During neural activation:

- HbO increases
- HbR decreases
- blood volume increases

>This pattern mirrors what we saw in ISI. The signal is vascular, not electrical.

:::

:::
:::column

![](images/ios_fnirs_response.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Spatio-temporal Resolution

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Spatial resolution:

- `centimeter-level` spatial resolution
- sensitivity to `superficial` cortex
- no access deep brain structures.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Temporal resolution:

- samples light at high frequency (tens of Hz)
- but reflects `slow` vascular dynamics (seconds)

>Temporal resolution is limited by physiology, not hardware.

:::

:::
:::

## The fNIRS device: basic components

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
An fNIRS system consists of:

- light `sources`
- light `detectors`
- `optodes` placed on the scalp
- acquisition and `processing unit`
:::

:::info-box
[Sources]{.highlight}:

- emit NIr light
- typically at 2 wavelengths
- are placed on the scalp

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
[Detectors]{.highlight}:

- measure light intensity exiting tissue
- are placed a few centimeters away from sources
- are sensitive to small changes in intensity

:::

:::info-box

An `optode` is a general term for:

- a `source` optode (emits light)
- a `detector` optode (collects light)

:::


:::
:::

## Source-detector pairing

:::columns
:::column

>Optodes are arranged in structured arrays on the scalp.

:::info-box
A source and a detector form a `channel`. The `distance` between them is typically:

- 2.5 to 3.5 cm in adults
- shorter in infants

This distance determines `sampling depth`.
:::

![](images/ios_fnirs_sensitivity_profile.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::column

:::card
The light path forms a curved trajectory called `Banana-shaped sensitivity profile`. Maximum sensitivity occurs approximately:

- halfway between source and detector
- at a depth of about half the separation distance

:::

:::card

Scalp blood flow contributes strongly. To control for this, systems include `Short (separation) channels`:

- short channels (8–10 mm distance)
- mainly sensitive to `superficial layers` of the tissue

These are used to regress out scalp effects.

:::

:::
:::

## Source-detector pairing

:::column

![](images/ios_fnirs_setup.jpg){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::column
![](images/ios_fnirs_short_channel.jpg){width="200" fig-align="center"}

:::card

fNIRS setup requires attention to:

- hair interference
- optode contact
- ambient light contamination

Signal quality depends strongly on preparation.
