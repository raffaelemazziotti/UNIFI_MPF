## What is Data Mining?

::: columns
:::column

Data mining is the process of:

- `Extracting patterns from data`  
- `Discovering structure` in complex datasets  
- Identifying predictive features  
- Transforming data into knowledge  

:::info-box
Modern datasets are:

- Multivariate
- High dimensional
- Non-linear
- Noisy

## What Is a Dataset?

:::columns
:::column 

:::info-box
A dataset is:

`An organized collection of information`

In biomarker research, a dataset usually contains:

- participants  
- measurements  
- clinical labels  

It is typically organized as a `table`.
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Most datasets are organized in rows and columns.

- Each `row` represents one participant  
- Each `column` represents one variable  
:::


|Participant | R T | Pupil Dilation | HbO | Diagnosis |  
|------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|-----------|  
|P01         | 520 ms        | 0.35 mm        | 1.2 µM        | Typical   | 
|P02         | 710 ms        | 0.62 mm        | 0.6 µM        | Disorder  |

:::columns
:::column 

:::info-box
`Features`

- measurable variables  
- reaction time  
- EEG power  
- questionnaire scores  
:::

:::info-box
`Label` or `Target variable`

- what we want to predict  
- diagnosis  
- symptom severity

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to:

> Computational systems that learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions.

::: columns
:::column

:::info-box
Artificial Intelligence is a broad field that includes:

- `Machine Learning` (ML): Algorithms learn patterns from data. 
- `Deep Learning`: Neural networks with many layers.
:::

::: 
:::column

![](images/dm_artificial_intelligence.png){width="600" fig-align="center"}

::: 
:::

## How AI Learns

::: columns
:::column

:::info-box
Most common `learning paradigms`:

[Supervised Learning]{.highlight}: 

Models are trained using labeled input-output pairs to predict outcomes for new data.

[Unsupervised Learning]{.highlight}:

Models that analyze and find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships in input data that is not labeled, categorized, or guided
:::

:::column

## Supervised vs UnSupervised Learning

::: columns
:::column

:::info-box
In `Supervised` learning we provide:

- measurements (features) 
- diagnosis  (labels)

The system learns:

`How to predict diagnosis from measurements`

>This is the most relevant approach for biomarkers.

:::

::: 
:::column

:::info-box
In `UnSupervised` learning we provide:

- measurements  
- no diagnosis  

The system tries to:

- discover natural groups  
- identify hidden structure  

>Useful for discovering subgroups.

:::

## Supervised vs UnSupervised Learning

![](images/dm_sup_unsup.png){width="350" fig-align="center"}

## What Is a Model?

::: columns
:::column

A model is:

A `rule` that combines `variables` to make predictions

:::card
Very simplified example:

`If`  
- reaction time is slow  
- pupil dilation is large  
- HbO is reduced  

`Then`  
probability of disorder increases.
:::

>The computer learns this rule automatically.


::: 
:::column

:::card
[Overfitting]{.highlight} occurs when a model learns training data too well, capturing `noise` and random fluctuations rather than just the underlying patterns.

How we prevent Overfitting?

Using `Cross-Validation`: testing the model on Data it has never seen before.
:::

## The Biomarker Discovery Pipeline

::: columns
:::column

1. `collect` data  
2. clean and `preprocess`  
3. `explore` variables  
4. `select relevant features`  
5. `train` predictive model  
6. `validate` on new data  
7. `interpret` carefully

## Why Use Orange?

::: columns
:::column

`Orange` is:

- free  
- visual  
- easy to use  
- designed for learning  

>No coding required.

## How Orange Works

::: columns
:::column

:::info-box
Orange uses visual blocks called `widgets`.

You connect them in a workflow.

Example:

Data → Model → Evaluation

>Each block performs one clear step.

## Loading a Dataset

::: columns
:::column

:::info-box
The main widget is:

`CSV import`

It allows you to:

- open a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file
- inspect variables  

After loading, the data can be sent to other widgets.

> For other file types you can also use the `File` widget

:::

## Data Table

::: columns
:::column

:::info-box
The `Data Table` widget lets you:

- see all participants  
- inspect variables  
- check missing values  

This is your first contact with the dataset.
:::

::: 
:::column

![](images/dm_orange_data_table.png){width="100" fig-align="left"}

::: 
:::

## Select Columns

::: columns
:::column

:::info-box
The `Select Columns` widget lets you:

- choose which variables are used for prediction  
- define the `target variable`  
- assign descriptive information as `meta`  

This is where you clearly define:

`What do I want to predict, and from which variables?`

## Exploring the Data

::: columns
:::column

Visualization helps us understand patterns.

:::card
`Distributions`

- inspect variable distributions  
:::

:::card
`Box Plot`

- compare groups  
:::

:::card
`Scatter Plot`

- explore relationships  
:::

::: 
:::column

## Models: Logistic Regression

::: columns
:::column

::: info-box
The `Logistic Regression` widget is a simple and interpretable classification model to classify data into two groups.
It:

- estimates the probability of belonging to a group  
- combines variables linearly  
- works well when relationships are relatively simple  
:::

::: info-box
It is often a good first model to try because:

- it is stable  
- it is easy to interpret
:::

::: 
:::column


::: 
:::

## Random Forest

The `Random Forest` widget is a more flexible and powerful model.

It:

- builds many decision trees  
- combines their predictions  
- handles complex and non-linear relationships  

It is useful when:

- variables interact with each other  
- patterns are not simple  
- prediction accuracy is the main goal 

## Support Vector Machine

:::info-box
The `Support Vector Machine` widget is a model that tries to find the best boundary between groups.

It:

- separates groups with an optimal decision boundary  
- can model complex patterns  
- works well in high-dimensional data  
:::

::: info-box
It is often effective when:

- groups overlap  
- there are many variables  
- the separation is subtle
