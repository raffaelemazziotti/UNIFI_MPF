## Why this course?

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Psychology traditionally relies on:

- behavior
- self-report
- clinical judgment

These tools are powerful, but `limited`.
:::

>Biomarkers promise objectivity, quantification, prediction, and personalization.

## The promise of biomarkers

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box

Biomarkers are expected to:

- reduce subjectivity
- link behavior to biology
- improve diagnosis and prognosis
- guide treatment decisions
- enable personalized approaches

>**Key question:**  
Do biomarkers actually deliver on these promises?

## What do we mean by “biomarker”?

A widely accepted formal definition ([NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) / [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/)):

> A [biomarker]{.highlight} is a defined `characteristic` that is `measured` as an `indicator` of normal biological **processes**, pathogenic processes, or *responses* to an intervention.

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Key points embedded in the definition:

- it is a *measurement*
- it is an *indicator*, not a diagnosis
- it is tied to a *specific process or response*
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Immediate implications:

- biomarkers are `indirect`
- biomarkers are `context-dependent`
- biomarkers are `not explanatory` by default
:::

## What do we mean by “biomarker”?

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Objective does not mean useful.  A measure can be:

- objective
- precise
- reproducible

And still be clinically useless.
:::

:::card
Typical reasons:

- large `overlap` between patients and controls
- `no added value` over clinical assessment

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Psychiatry and psychology still lack:

- `robust` diagnostic biomarkers
- clinically actionable predictors

Many proposed biomarkers:

- are statistically significant
- `fail` in real clinical settings

## The core epistemological problem

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Neurological, Psychiatric and Psychological phenomena are:

- heterogeneous
- dynamic
- multidimensional

>Biological systems reflect this complexity.
As a result, one-to-one mappings  
(one biomarker → one disorder) are rare.

:::

graph LR
    B1[Biomarker A] --> D1[Disorder 1]
    B1 --> D2[Disorder 2]

    B2[Biomarker B] --> D1
    B2 --> D3[Disorder 3]

    B3[Biomarker C] --> D2
    B3 --> D3

    subgraph Biomarkers
        B1
        B2

    subgraph Disorders

        D2
        D3
    end
```

## Biomarkers are not “truth machines”

:::columns
:::column

>Biomarkers do not reveal truth directly.
They are `probabilistic` signals.

:::info-box
Most biomarkers are `correlates`, not causes.

A biomarker may:

- change with a disorder
- track symptom severity
- predict outcomes

Without explaining why. [Biomarkers are not mechanisms]{.highlight}.

## Group-level vs individual-level thinking

:::columns
:::column
>Most biomarkers are discovered at the `group level`.
Clinical decisions are made at the individual level.

:::info-box
Research question:

- “Is there a difference between groups?”

Clinical question:

- “Can I make a decision for this person?”

These are fundamentally different problems.
:::


:::
:::column

:::info-box
A biomarker can be:

- statistically significant
- and useless for deciding about a single patient
:::

:::info-box
Biomarkers should be understood as:

- decision-support tools
- not decision-makers

They complement:

- clinical judgment
- contextual information
:::

:::
:::

## What counts as a biomarker?

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
A biomarker can be:

- `molecular` (genes, proteins, metabolites)
- `physiological` (heart rate variability, cortisol)
  - neural (EEG features, imaging-derived measures)
  - behavioral (reaction times, eye movements)
- `computational` (scores derived from multiple measures)
:::

>Biomarkers are **not limited to biology at the molecular level**.
