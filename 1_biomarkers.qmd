## Why this course?

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Psychology traditionally relies on:

- behavior
- self-report
- clinical judgment

These tools are powerful, but `limited`.
:::

>Biomarkers promise objectivity, quantification, prediction, and personalization.

:::
:::column

![](images/biom_self_report.png){width="350" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## The promise of biomarkers

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box

Biomarkers are expected to:

- reduce subjectivity
- link behavior to biology
- improve diagnosis and prognosis
- guide treatment decisions
- enable personalized approaches

>**Key question:**  
Do biomarkers actually deliver on these promises?

:::

:::
:::column

![](docs/images/biom_representative.png){width="350" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## What do we mean by “biomarker”?

A widely accepted formal definition ([NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) / [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/)):

> A [biomarker]{.highlight} is a defined `characteristic` that is `measured` as an `indicator` of normal biological **processes**, pathogenic processes, or *responses* to an intervention.

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Key points embedded in the definition:

- it is a *measurement*
- it is an *indicator*, not a diagnosis
- it is tied to a *specific process or response*
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Immediate implications:

- biomarkers are `indirect`
- biomarkers are `context-dependent`
- biomarkers are `not explanatory` by default
:::

:::
:::

## What do we mean by “biomarker”?

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Objective does not mean useful.  A measure can be:

- objective
- precise
- reproducible

And still be clinically useless.
:::

:::card
Typical reasons:

- large `overlap` between patients and controls
- `no added value` over clinical assessment

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Psychiatry and psychology still lack:

- `robust` diagnostic biomarkers
- clinically actionable predictors

Many proposed biomarkers:

- are statistically significant
- `fail` in real clinical settings

![](docs/images/biom_fail.jpg){width="300" fig-align="center"}
:::


:::
:::

## The core epistemological problem

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Neurological, Psychiatric and Psychological phenomena are:

- heterogeneous
- dynamic
- multidimensional

>Biological systems reflect this complexity.
As a result, one-to-one mappings  
(one biomarker → one disorder) are rare.

:::

:::
:::column

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    B1[Biomarker A] --> D1[Disorder 1]
    B1 --> D2[Disorder 2]

    B2[Biomarker B] --> D1
    B2 --> D3[Disorder 3]

    B3[Biomarker C] --> D2
    B3 --> D3

        D2
        D3
    end
```

:::

## Biomarkers are not “truth machines”

:::columns
:::column

>Biomarkers do not reveal truth directly.
They are `probabilistic` signals.

:::info-box
Most biomarkers are `correlates`, not causes.

A biomarker may:

- change with a disorder
- track symptom severity
- predict outcomes

Without explaining why. [Biomarkers are not mechanisms]{.highlight}.
:::

:::
:::

## Group-level vs individual-level thinking

:::columns
:::column
>Most biomarkers are discovered at the `group level`.
Clinical decisions are made at the individual level.

:::info-box
Research question:

- “Is there a difference between groups?”

Clinical question:

- “Can I make a decision for this person?”

These are fundamentally different problems.
:::


:::
:::column

:::info-box
A biomarker can be:

- statistically significant
- and useless for deciding about a single patient
:::

:::info-box
Biomarkers should be understood as:

- decision-support tools
- not decision-makers

They complement:

- clinical judgment
- contextual information
:::

:::
:::

## What counts as a biomarker?

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
A biomarker can be:

- `molecular` (genes, proteins, metabolites)
- `physiological` (heart rate variability, cortisol)
  - neural (EEG features, imaging-derived measures)
  - behavioral (reaction times, eye movements)
- `computational` (scores derived from multiple measures)
:::

>Biomarkers are **not limited to biology at the molecular level**.

:::
:::column

![](docs/images/biom_types(1).png){width="350" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## What a biomarker is NOT

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
A biomarker is not:

- a diagnosis
- a symptom
- a risk factor
- an endophenotype
- a clinical judgment
- a mechanism 
:::


>A biomarker can be a `risk factor`, but not all risk factors are biomarkers.

:::
:::column

:::card

Mechanisms:

- explain how a process works
- imply causal structure

:::


:::card
Endophenotypes:

- are heritable traits
- lie between genes and behavior
- are relatively stable

:::

:::
:::

## Context of Use (CoU)

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
A biomarker is only defined together with:

- a `target` population
- a clinical or research `question`

Without a `Context` of Use:

- performance cannot be evaluated
- usefulness cannot be judged

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
The same measured characteristic can be:

- a biomarker in one context
- irrelevant in another
- misleading in a third
:::


:::
:::

## Biomarkers are multidimensional objects

:::columns
:::column

>Biomarkers are often introduced as simple categories or lists.
In reality, biomarkers vary along multiple `dimensions`.

:::info-box
Dimension 1: Biological Level

- molecular
- cellular
- physiological
- neural
- behavioral
:::

:::
:::column

:::card
Lower-level does not mean:

- more objective
- more specific
- more clinically useful

A genetic marker can be less useful than a behavioral one.

:::

![](docs/images/biom_levels.png){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Dimension 2: Temporal stability

:::columns
:::column

Biomarkers differ in [how they change over time]{.highlight}. Two broad [classes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29687938/):

- `trait`-like biomarkers
- `state`-dependent biomarkers

:::info-box
`Trait` biomarkers are:

- relatively stable
- minimally affected by context
- often present before symptoms

>Examples: genetic variants, structural brain features.
They are often used for risk or susceptibility.

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
`State` biomarkers:

- fluctuate over time
- reflect current condition or context
- are sensitive to environment and intervention

>Examples: cortisol, EEG power, arousal

:::

| Biomarker  | Key properties | Main limitation       |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Trait  | Stable         | Often weak predictors |
| State  | Sensitive      | Prone to bias         |

:::
:::

## Dimension 3: Specificity

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box

Biomarkers differ in how `specific` they are.

Specificity can be:

- disorder-specific
- dimension-specific
- transdiagnostic

Psychological/Psychiatric biomarkers are often `transdiagnostic`.

:::

:::card
Many biomarkers in Psychology:

- appear across multiple disorders
- reflect shared processes

:::


:::
:::column

:::info-box
Mental disorders are:

- heterogeneous
- overlapping
- not defined by single mechanisms

Therefore, biomarkers rarely show one-to-one mappings.

:::


:::
:::

## Dimension 4: Measurement context

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Biomarkers depend on:

- how they are measured
- where they are measured
- under which conditions
:::

:::info-box
`Laboratory vs real-world` measures can differ substantially.
A biomarker may work:

- in controlled experimental settings
- but fail in clinical practice
:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
Measurement context directly affects:

- reliability
- validity
- interpretability
:::

:::
:::

## Dimension 5: Functional role

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Biomarkers differ by **what they are used for**:

- `detection`
- `prediction`
- `monitoring`
- `stratification`

The same biomarker can serve different `roles`.
:::

:::
:::column

:::card
Example: EEG feature

- diagnostic marker in one context
- prognostic marker in another
- monitoring marker in treatment studies

Function is not intrinsic to the measure.
:::

:::
:::

## Biomarker Evaluation

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
Biomarkers are not evaluated by intuition.

They are evaluated by:

- measurement `quality`
- `error` structure
- `decision` consequences
:::

:::info-box
A biomarker must be reliable before being useful.

Reliability refers to:

- `test-retest` stability
- `inter-rater` consistency
- robustness `across contexts`

:::

:::
:::column

:::card

If a biomarker varies because of:

- measurement noise
- equipment differences
- context instability

Then any observed association may be spurious. Reliability sets the upper limit of usefulness.

:::


:::
:::

## Biomarker Evaluation: Validity

:::columns
:::column

:::card
[Validity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)) is `contextual` and it is not a single property. A biomarker can be:

- valid for one purpose
- invalid for another
:::

:::info-box
Key forms of validity:

- [construct validity](https://www.simplypsychology.org/construct-validity-definition-examples.html)
- [criterion validity](https://www.simplypsychology.org/criterion-validity-definition-examples.html)
- [predictive validity](https://www.simplypsychology.org/predictive-validity.html)

Predictive validity is the `most relevant` for clinical use.
:::


:::
:::column

![](docs/images/biom_validity.png){width="200" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Error Structure
:::columns
:::column

Every biomarker makes `errors`.
There is no error-free biomarker.

:::info-box
When using a biomarker to `classify` or `predict`, there are 4 possible outcomes:

- true positive
- false positive
- true negative
- false negative

Every decision falls into one of these categories.

## Error Structure

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box
A `false positive` occurs when:

- the biomarker indicates a condition
- but the condition is not present

Consequences:

- unnecessary alarm
- overdiagnosis
- inappropriate intervention

:::

:::
:::column

:::info-box
A `false negative` occurs when:

- the biomarker fails to detect a condition
- that is actually present

Consequences:

- missed diagnosis
- delayed intervention
- false reassurance

:::

:::
:::

>Which error is worse depends on `context`.

## Accuracy, Sensitivity and specificity

:::columns
:::column

:::info-box

`Accuracy`:

- Ability to detect a condition correctly

`Sensitivity`:

- ability to detect a condition when it is present

`Specificity`:

- ability to exclude a condition when it is absent


:::

>They describe different aspects of performance.

:::
:::column

:::card
Increasing sensitivity often:

- increases false positives

Increasing specificity often:

- increases false negatives

A confusion matrix, also known as `error matrix` is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of a Biomarker.

## Thresholds create errors

:::columns
:::column

>Most biomarkers require a `threshold`.

:::info-box
Changing the threshold:

- changes sensitivity
- changes specificity
- changes error balance
:::

:::info-box
[ROC curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) describe:

- trade-offs between sensitivity and false positives
- performance across thresholds

:::

:::
:::column

![](docs/images/biom_roc.jpg){width="500" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Clinical utility is not accuracy

High accuracy alone is insufficient.

Clinical utility depends on:

- `consequences of errors`
- possibility to use `across contexts`
- added value over `clinical judgment`

A slightly better biomarker can still be useless.

## Functional classification of biomarkers

According to regulatory and clinical frameworks, biomarkers can be used as:

- `diagnostic`
- `prognostic`
- `predictive`
- `monitoring`

## Diagnostic biomarkers

:::columns
:::column

`Diagnostic` (classification) biomarkers are used to:

- `detect the presence` of a condition
- support or refine a diagnosis
- identify subtypes of a condition

:::info-box
For diagnostic biomarkers:

- false positives are especially harmful
- specificity is critical
- prevalence strongly affects usefulness
:::

:::
:::column

:::card
They answer the question:

`Is this condition present?`
:::

![](docs/images/biom_diagnostic.png){width="200" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Prognostic biomarkers

:::columns
:::column

`Prognostic` biomarkers provide information about:

- future course of a condition
- likelihood of progression, relapse, or recovery

:::info-box
Prognostic biomarkers:

- are independent of treatment
- describe natural history
- often work at the group level

:::

:::
:::column

:::card
They answer the question:

`What is likely to happen over time?`
:::

![](docs/images/biom_prognostic.png){width="250" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Predictive biomarkers

:::columns
:::column

`Predictive` biomarkers estimate:

- likelihood of response to an intervention
- likelihood of side effects

:::info-box
Predictive biomarkers are:

- central to personalized medicine
- highly attractive clinically
- extremely difficult to validate

They require comparison across treatments.

:::

:::
:::column


:::card
They answer the question:
`Will this treatment work for this person?`
:::

![](docs/images/biom_predictive.png){width="250" fig-align="center"}

:::
:::

## Monitoring biomarkers

:::columns
:::column

`Monitoring` biomarkers are used to:

- track changes over time
- assess response or progression
- support ongoing decisions

:::info-box
Examples:

- physiological stress markers
- EEG changes during treatment
- behavioral performance over time
:::


:::
:::column

:::card
They answer the question:

`Is the condition changing over time?`
